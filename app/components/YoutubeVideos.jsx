          <h3>Vehicle Spare Parts Management System</h3>
          <p>
            I have created a Vehicle Spare Parts Management System using JSP and
            Servlet based on the JAVA language. By using this vehicle Spare
            Parts Management System Stock managers can do their stock managing
            operation efficiently. In this system, I have to implement essential
            stock managing operations such as online stock payment, requesting
            stock details, and adding stock details. All these operations of
            vehicle spare parts managing. To do that, I have created the spare
            part manager dashboard in this system. By using this dashboard, the
            bank manager can easily communicate with their stakeholders

          <h3>ART ZONE mobile application</h3>
          <p>
            According to our mobile application, I am supposed to create Event
            Handling and create a simple Music player as my function. By using
            simple sub-interface users can view events and listen to calm
            painting music. if there is an exhibition or art event occurs the
            details admin can add that new event to the application and also
            perform updates and delete those events. in additionally if there is
            a special event. admin can highlight this event, as a special event
            by marking a star symbol In the upper right corner of the special
            event. as well, the star-removing function also can perform when
            unnecessary. When there are many Events in this app, users can find
            a specific event by searching that event details as a keyword. while
            every function works as a user can see what s happening as a toast
            message. If the user wants to listen to calm music while painting,
            by using the sub-interface user can navigate to the music player.

          <h3>Pharmacy prescription management system </h3>
          <p>
            In this function, there are three main parts: online prescription
            orders of customers, pharmacy prescription orders of pharmacists and
            admin part of the prescription management. Customers can easily and
            quickly get the medicine they need in the online prescription orders
            part by entering their details and uploading a prescription image
            online. Then the entered details are checked by the pharmacist,
            validated, corrected, and finally, the customer is given the
            required product or service promptly by the pharmacist. In pharmacy
            prescription orders, the product or service is provided through a
            prescription to the customer. The pharmacist checks the prescription
            letters received from the customer and, after entering the medicine
            into the system, checks the system and dispenses the necessary
            medication promptly. If required by the pharmacist, essential
            information can be obtained by searching. Also, this information can
            be updated if needed by the premises. And here, the report of the
            data entered in the pharmacy can also be obtained as a PDF. Finally,
            in the admin part of prescription managing Admin can get necessary
            information by searching. Also, the admin can update the information
            related to this prescription management system if necessary. And
            here, if there are problems in the data entered by the pharmacist,
            they can be corrected, and if the system has extraneous information,
            they can be deleted.

            {" "}
            we present our group project developed during the AF module at
            SLIIT. We showcase the process of building a comprehensive
            Government Complaint System using the MERN stack (MongoDB,
            Express.js, React, and Node.js). Our complaint system aims to
            provide a user-friendly interface for citizens to report their
            grievances and concerns to the government. Through this system,
            users can submit complaints, track their progress, and receive
            updates on the status of their complaints. We start by explaining
            the key features and functionality of our Government Complaint
            System, including user registration, login, and authentication. We
            then demonstrate how users can create and submit complaints,
            attaching relevant information and supporting documents.
            Additionally, we discuss the backend implementation using Node.js
            and Express.js, where we handle complaint data, perform validation,
            and store it in a MongoDB database. We explain the API endpoints
            used for communication between the frontend and backend. The
            frontend of our system is built using React, ensuring a responsive
            and intuitive user interface....
