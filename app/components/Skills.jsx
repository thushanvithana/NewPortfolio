          <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
          <p>
            I learned Python as my first programming language. I was
            insatiable.so I went for JavaScript. Then, I made developing
            responsive websites & love to work with the back-end and develop
            REST-APIs. I love to work with both web-based, multi-threaded
            applications as well as front-end development & back-end development
            using the latest web technologies. Iâ€™m familiar with a variety of
            programming languages, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery,
            React, NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDB, PHP, MYSQL, C, and Java. No
            matter what, I enjoy adding new skills to my repertoire.
